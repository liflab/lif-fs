Java provides various ways to access and manipulate files; however, depending on where these files are located, they are exposed through different classes and methods. If the files are on a local folder, they are accessed using the `File` class and its associated methods; if they are inside a zip file, the `ZipInputStream` and `ZipOutputStream` objects must be used according to a completely different workflow; if the same files are accessible over an FTP connection, yet other objects and methods are required.

The *lif-fs* library defines an interface called `FileSystem` that exposes files through a simple and **uniform** set of methods:

- `open` and `close` start and end the interaction with the file system. Any other operation is invalid if invoked before `open` or after `close`.
- `writeTo` is given a filename and returns an `OutputStream` to which data can be written. Closing the stream causes the file to be written.
- `readFrom` is given a filename and returns an `InputStream` from which data can be read.
- `rm` deletes a file
- `mkdir` and `rmdir` respectively create and delete a folder.
- `ls` lists the contents of a folder.
- `chdir` changes the current directory. All operations are performed relatively to this current directory. Commands `pushd` and `popd` allow a stack of current directories to be pushed/popped.

This interface abstracts away the actual *physical* location of the files being manipulated, as well as the specific *means* by which these files are stored and accessed. A consumer of a `FileSystem` object needs not be aware that the underlying file system is concretely stored as...

- a local drive (`HardDisk`)
- an FTP connection (`FtpConnection`)
- a zip file (`ReadZipFile`, `WriteZipFile`)
- a temporary folder (`TempFolder`)
- a tar archive
- a database table
- a ramdisk (`RamDisk`)
- a Java `properties` file
- a set of WebDAV resources

As another interesting side effect, many file system objects of the library take as input another file system instance, or a stream from another file system instance. In this way, they can alter the way in which the resources of the underlying file system are accessed.

Examples
--------

Here are some examples of the tasks that you can do by mixing together various instances of the `FileSystem` interface.

### Give read-only access to a folder of the local machine

In this example, a folder of the local machine is exposed as a root of some file system object. This file system is then passed to the `ReadOnlyFileSystem` object that disables all write access to the underlying file system. This example also shows a first use of the `FileUtils` object, whose method `toBytes` can turn an `InputStream` into an array of bytes.

```java
// Open file system
FileSystem fs = new ReadOnlyFileSystem(new HardDisk("/path/to/folder"));

// Change to folder; internally resolves to /path/to/folder/foo
fs.chdir("/foo");

// Read contents of a file: OK
byte[] contents = FileUtils.toBytes(fs.readFrom("bar.txt"));

// Try to write contents: throws an exception
OutputStream os = fs.writeTo("baz/somefile.txt");
```

### Give size-constrained access to a folder of the local machine

It is also possible to restrict the total space that a file system is allowed to use. In the example below, the `fs` instance will throw an exception whenever an operation makes the directory `/path/to/folder` occupy more than 1 MB.

```java
// Open file system
FileSystem fs = new ThrottledFileSystem(new HardDisk("/path/to/folder"));
fs.setSizeLimit(1000000);

// Get and output stream and try to write a big file
OutputStream os = fs.writeTo("foobar.txt");
os.write(new byte[2000000]); // Too big: throws an exception
```

### List files contained in a zip file obtained from an FTP connection

This example shows how a stream from a file system can be passed as the input of another file system object. Here, an FTP connection is open, and a zip file accessible through that connection is exposed as another file system, which can be transparently manipulated as any other.

```java
// Open an FTP connection and navigate to a remote folder
FileSystem ftp = new FtpConnection("10.1.2.3", "user", "pass");
ftp.open();
ftp.chdir("/home/sylvain/myfolder");

// Get a hold of a zip file inside the FTP repository
ReadZipFile zip = new ReadZipFile(ftp.readFrom("myarchive.zip"));
zip.open();
List<String> listing = zip.ls();

// Close resources
zip.close();
ftp.close();
```

In this example, it is worth noting that no file transfer is explicitly done. The transfer of the zip file is implicitly executed on the call to `zip.open()`. Also worthy of mention is the fact that `zip.ls` fetches an in-memory cache of the archive's directory, and does not require the file to be tranferred multiple times.

### Write files to a zip that is uploaded by FTP

In this more complex example, a file system open on an FTP connection is first created. Another file system is used to write files that will be stored into a zip file, which is written into a stream obtained from the FTP connection. Note how there is no explicit notion of "transferring" files: the transfer is implicit by the way streams are instantiated and passed. In other words, the `WriteZipFile` object has no idea it is writing its contents into a stream that comes from an FTP file system.

```java
// Open an FTP connection and navigate to a remote folder
FileSystem ftp = new FtpConnection("10.1.2.3", "user", "pass");
ftp.open();
ftp.chdir("/home/sylvain/myfolder");

// Get an output stream to write to a file
OutputStream os = ftp.writeTo("myarchive.zip");

// Open a zip file system, and instruct it to write itself in this output stream
FileSystem z = new WriteZipFile(os);

// Create folders within the archive
z.mkdir("foo");
z.mkdir("bar");

// Write a first file
{
  PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(z.writeTo("/foo/foobar.txt"));
  ps.print("Hello world");
  ps.close(); // Closing ps adds the file to the archive
}

// Write a second file
{
  z.chdir("bar");
  PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(z.writeTo("foobaz.txt"));
  ps.print("The quick brown fox");
  ps.close(); // Closing ps adds the file to the archive
}

// Closing z writes the zip file in the output stream
z.close();

// Closing os sends the zip file by FTP
os.close();

// Closing ftp ends the connection
ftp.close();
```

### Read and write files as local database entries

This example shows that the `JdbcFileSystem` object stores files as entries in a table. A column called "name" contains the filename, and a column called "content" contains a BLOB with the contents of the file. Users of the `JdbcFileSystem` are given access to these files as if they were stored in a hierarchical file system.

```java
FileSystem db = new JdbcFileSystem("localhost", "user", "pass", "dbname", "table");
db.chdir("/my/folder");

// Write a file
PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(z.writeTo("foo/foobar.txt"));
ps.print("Hello world");
ps.close(); // Closing ps adds the file to the table in the database

// Read another file
db.chdir("../bar");
Scanner s = new Scanner(db.readFrom("foobaz.txt"));
while (s.hasNextLine()) {
  // Do stuff with the file's content
}
s.close();

// Closing db ends the connection with the database
db.close();
```

### Recursively dump an FTP folder to the local file system

This example makes use of the `FileUtils` utility class, whose `copy()` method can be used to transfer all files and folders of a file system object to another one.

```java
// Open a file system to some local folder
FileSystem local = new HardDisk("/home/sylvain/somefolder");
local.open();

// Open a file system to some remote folder
FileSystem remote = new FtpConnection("10.1.2.3", "user", "pass");
remote.open();
remote.chdir("some/other/folder");

// Recursively copy all files from remote into local
FileUtils.copy(remote, local);

// Close the connections
local.close();
remote.close();
```

### Simulate an old floppy drive

This example may look a bit strange, but it shows what is possible using descendants of the `ThrottledFileSystem`. Here, we allocate a portion of memory and make its capacity and transfer speed approximate that of an old 360 kb 5Â¼" floppy disk. Assuming that `bigfile.bin` is a file that exceeds the size of the floppy, the last instruction will take some time to execute, and eventually throw an exception once the "disk" is full.

```java
// Open floppy
FileSystem floppy = new FloppyDisk(new RamDisk(), FloppyType.F_360);
floppy.open();

// Open hard disk
FileSystem hd = new HardDisk("/home/sylvain/somefolder");
hd.open();

// Try to copy a big file into the floppy
FileUtils.copy(hd.readFrom("bigfile.bin"), floppy.writeTo("bigfile.bin"));
```
