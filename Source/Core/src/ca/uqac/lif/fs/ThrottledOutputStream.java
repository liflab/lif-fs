/**
 * The ThrottledOutputStream provides bandwidth throttling on a specified
 * OutputStream. It is implemented as a wrapper on top of another OutputStream
 * instance.
 * The throttling works by examining the number of bytes written to the underlying
 * OutputStream from the beginning, and sleep()ing for a time interval if
 * the byte-transfer is found exceed the specified tolerable maximum.
 * (Thus, while the read-rate might exceed the maximum for a given short interval,
 * the average tends towards the specified maximum, overall.)
 * <p>
 * In addition, the class can be given a maximum number of bytes it is allowed
 * to write to the underlying output stream. It throws an {@link IOException}
 * if a call to {@link #write(int) write()} exceeds this limit.
